      <description>C is one of my favorite weekend langauges due to its extreme simplicity and complexity. For proficiency in C programming, the user must first have a functional understanding of memory and assembly language. Without this understanding, some concepts, such as pointers, will only be used in a very limited capacity. In assembly language, every part of a program operates on and interacts with memory. The variables are stored in memory, the function definitions are stored in memory, and most importantly, instructions are stored in memory.</description>
